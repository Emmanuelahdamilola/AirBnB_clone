AirBnB clone - The console

DESCRIPTION:
The console is the first part of the AirBnB project at Holberton School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this part to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

An imperative interface for overseeing our Airbnb clone entities:

1. Generate a fresh entity (e.g., a new User or a new Place).
2. Fetch an entity from various sources such as files, databases, and more.
3. Perform actions on entities, such as counting or computing statistics.
4. Modify attributes of an entity.
5. Eradicate an entity when necessary.

HOW TO USE:
1. Clone this repository: git clone 
2. Access AirBnb directory: cd AirBnB_clone
3. Run hbnb(interactively): ./console and enter command
4. Run hbnb(non-interactively): echo "<command>" | ./console.py
